the [reactivated](https://llllllll.co/t/discord-norns-study-group/14233/27) norns study group celebrated its second month of discord today. we have been meeting weekly since october. today we had our first meta-retro to discuss how the study group is going and what changes we want to make in 2021.

going forward we are planning several things:

- this website: a place to share what weâ€™re working on
- more structured mentor/mentee relationships
- monthly projects
- a #stupid-questions channel where all messages are deleted after 24 hours
- a dedicated #sc channel for supercollider specific discussion
- more focused "TED talk" deep dives

most of the action happens in the [discord](https://discord.com/invite/hfC5Fmw), so come on in and say hi!
